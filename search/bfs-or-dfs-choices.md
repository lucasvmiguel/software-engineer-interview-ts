# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

BFS

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:

BFS (DFS would take a long time)

# If the tree is very wide:

DFS (BFS would need too much memory)

# If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

DFS

# Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:

DFS

# Finding the shortest path:

BFS
